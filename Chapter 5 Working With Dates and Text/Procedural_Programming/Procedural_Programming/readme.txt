- In procedural programming we use methods to seperate code so we can reuse it and not repeat ourselves.
- Here we get the exercise that we reverse the name and create method that's gonna reuse it anywhere we want, and a method that returns unique numbers.
- Our application console is only used in console applications but the reverse array can be used anywhere or the unique numbers
- so we need to seperate the logic.
